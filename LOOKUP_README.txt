Description:
This lookup table maps the 'small_area' identifier to higher level administrative and geographic units, with accompanying demographic data.

Use Cases:
- Aggregating results to local authority, regional, national levels
- Linking to demographic or socio-economic datasets
- Calculate and visualise per capita or per household data

Join Key:
Use 'small_area' to join to the tabular data in /data/ and geometry in /shapefile/.

Note:
Some small areas have undergone boundary changes between 2011 and 2021. The lookup standardises these to ensure consistent aggregation.
